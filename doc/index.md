# DanceMF

Now you are learning about DanceMF. It's a simple application framework for Javascript.

It has things you know like...

* models, views and controllers
* client storage and REST support
* observer pattern of model properties
* an event hub with fancy stuff like late-binding listeners
* lots of unit tests

It doesn't have...

* any dependencies
* any templates
* support for older browsers
* layers and layers of abstraction
* a bad back

This is a project that is just getting underway and in active development. There is no friendly documentation but there are lots of tests that can give you an idea of where this thing is going.
