# DanceMF

Now you are learning about DanceMF. It's a simple application framework for Javascript.

It has things you know like...

* models, views and controllers
* client storage and REST support
* observer pattern of model properties
* an event hub with fancy stuff like late-binding listeners
* lots of unit tests

It doesn't have...

* any dependencies
* any templates
* support for older browsers
* layers and layers of abstraction
* a runny nose

Yes, DanceMF is fit and healthy and young and, rightly or wrongly, doesn't think about old people like IE8. If you are using DanceMF you are targeting modern, standards-compliant environments only.
